            <p class="h2">I am a free lancing programmer that’s on the quest of becoming a full stack web <br>developer
                that’s capable of handling both front-end and back-end code with ease<br>
                to create beautiful looking websites that are colorful and interactive.</p>
                <p><b class="d2">The Journey</b></p>
            <p class="h3">As soon as i completed my HTML course with Solo Learning, I created this<br>
                webpage with the skills I gained and will hopefully keep making it beautiful and<br>
                more appealing as I continue on my road.<br>
                This is Day Two and i have learnt how to apply CSS to my webpage in order<br>
                to create beautifullooking websites in the future.
